Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images using Microsoft ML.Net, TensorFlow, Technologies

Dataset Initiation Process

Joseph Paul Cohen is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging at Stanford. Joseph was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Mila and the University of Montreal. Joseph is currently focusing on the limits of AI in medicine with respect to computer vision and clinical data. He holds a PhD Degree in Computer Science and Machine Learning from the University of Massachusetts Boston.

Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen collected X-Ray images of COVID-19 Cases and Published them in GitHub Repo.

Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of a patient’s lungs. And given that nearly all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, it could be possible to use X-rays to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits. Dr. Cohen has generated Python Scripts to Build, Train and Run Datasets. 

Cloudsol Team from Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India, (Selwyn Abraham, Preethi Patrick- Tech Lead) utilized the GitHub-> COVID-19-Chest-X-Ray-Dataset images and Metadata Open Source Data Services and Microsoft Machine Learning ML.Net and TexsorFlow Open Source Platform to Build, Train and Run the Machine Module using ML.Net Servcies.

Our heartfelt thanks to Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen and Microsoft Corporation for sharing the Data and Development Technology (ML.Net & TensorFLow Interoperability Services) respectively to make this Project a great success. We acknowledge the services of Cloudsol Data Support Engineers: John Dhanaraj, Packiyaraj and Jaisha.

Labelling: Corona Positive Cases and Unclear Cases

Now, we are capable of detecting COVID -19 +ve and -ve Cases based on Patient’s Chest X-Ray Images using Emerging Technologies: Microsoft ML.Net and TensorFlow Interoperability Services.

We are happy to quote Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen’s Comments on: “Radiology Report using Machine Learning” that X-ray analysis requires a radiology expert and takes significant time — which is precious when people are sick around the world. Therefore developing an automated analysis system is required to save medical professionals valuable time.

We release this COVID-19 Diagnosis & Detection Application Services as COVID-19 Open Source Software to the Deserving Community Worldwide.
